# Introduction

Hello, my name is Akinahom Wabella, and I am a data science enthusiast with a keen interest in quantitative analysis and its applications in finance and space exploration. My journey in data science has led me to explore various facets of machine learning, data preprocessing, and modeling, particularly focusing on projects related to space and quantitative trading.

## Interests and Projects

### Predicting Stock Prices Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis

This project involves developing a model to predict stock prices by integrating machine learning techniques with sentiment analysis. Key aspects include:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering historical stock data and sentiment data from financial news, social media, and other sources. Preprocessing these datasets to handle missing values, normalize data, and extract relevant features using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of news articles and social media posts, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests to predict stock price movements based on historical data and sentiment scores.

- **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Optimizing models for better accuracy and robustness.

### Personalized Investment Predictor for College Students using Notion Clone UI

In this project, I developed a personalized investment predictor designed specifically for college students, with a user interface inspired by Notion. The project highlights include:

- **User Interface Development**: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface using web development technologies like React.js and CSS, emulating the Notion UI.

- **Investment Strategy Personalization**: Developing algorithms to recommend personalized investment strategies based on the userâ€™s financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

- **Data Integration**: Integrating financial data from various APIs to provide up-to-date information on stocks, bonds, and other investment options.

- **Backend Development**: Implementing backend services using Flask and Django to handle user data securely, process financial data, and execute investment predictions.

- **Security and Privacy**: Ensuring data privacy and security through secure communication channels and data encryption.

## Research Interests

I am particularly interested in conducting research on the following topics to further my career in quant and data science:

1. **Time Series Analysis for Stock Price Prediction**
2. **Machine Learning for Credit Risk Assessment**
3. **Algorithmic Trading Strategies Using Reinforcement Learning**
